I grew up watching Gundam Wing on Toonami, and G Gundam later on online. As I grew older, I spent more time branching out into the shows, eventually watching Universal Century and now Gundam 00 and Unicorn Gundam. My first Gunpla (or model kit) was a high grade Deathscythe from Gundam Wing. I was so excited to build it that I didn't wait for my parents help and, though I was able to finish the model, I did a terrible job in making the build nice and clean. Since then I've built a multitude of kits, from master grades to real grades and have vastly expanded my skill. I've loved every minute of the hobby, from learning new materials to use in scratch building to how to effectively panel line and detail beautiful models. Please take the time to browse both my write ups on specific tools, materials and techniques. And while you're at it, check out the photos of builds I've done!
